# Lets_meet_meeting_webapp

Virtual Meetings are in use since long time, but the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting  stay-at-home orders have led to significant changes in the way people work. One of these changes involves increased use of video conferencing as a means of communicating or holding work meetings. But there were many things we missed while joining or taking virtual meetings. To fix all the things that no one is providing in any virtual meet app, we come up with the idea of ‘Let’s Meet’. We figured out the flaws and drawbacks in already available online meeting web apps and worked for the solution.

Virtual Meetings are need of this Era. Virtual meetings are real-time interactions that take place over the Internet using integrated audio and video, chat tools, and application sharing. A virtual meeting is when individuals in various locations connect at the same time using technology to accomplish a shared goal. They offer a way to engage students in fully interactive, online learning experiences such as lectures, discussions, and tutoring.

In this age, basically all types of meetings, whether it is corporate, political or educational, is mostly taking place online virtually. Specially, for educational meetings, there should be some necessary feature added in a virtual meeting app which are very important for the faculty as well as students. We are proposing and implementing those features in our virtual meeting app ‘Let’s Meet’.

The virtual meeting app must have direct file sharing feature, so that anyone can share files with different formats directly in ongoing classes.

Meeting recording is available in virtual meeting apps but there is so much delay in processing the recorded file for download.

The aim of the project is to provide much better experience with new and very important features to the students and faculty. Bringing the features which are very useful but not available in any virtual meeting app.
